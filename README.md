# Kona

Highlight anything you read — AI chats or ordinary web pages — add a note, and find it again in one click. Everything stays on your computer.

*कोना — "corner". The folded one you leave in a page so you can find your way back.*

> **Status:** early prototype, not in the Chrome Web Store yet. Install it yourself with the steps below.

## What it does

**While you read**
- Select text in any message on **ChatGPT**, **Claude** or **Gemini** and pick a color.
- Or right-click the selection and choose **Highlight with Kona** — handy on sites whose own selection popup covers ours.
- Switch it on for **any other site** from the toolbar button: blogs, docs, Stack Overflow, GitHub.
- Switch any site **off** from the same button, the chat sites included. Everything disappears on that site and selections are ignored, while your highlights stay saved and return when you switch it back on. "Forget" an added site to hand its permission back to Chrome as well.
- Add a note to any highlight with the ✎ button, or by clicking highlighted text later. Highlights with notes get a dotted underline.
- Tag a highlight in the same box. Tags pull related highlights together across chats and sites.
- A side panel lists this page's highlights, numbered in the order you made them. Drag the ⋮⋮ grip to reorder, hover an entry to light up its highlight, click it to jump there.
- In a long chat, jumping to a highlight in a part the site hasn't loaded yet scrolls up for you until it finds it.
- Coloured ticks beside the scrollbar show where your highlights are on the page, with a box marking what's on screen. Click a tick to jump there.
- Deleting a highlight leaves an **Undo** for a few seconds, in the page and in the library.
- Highlighting waits while a reply is still being written.

**Afterwards**
- `Alt+Shift+F` opens a search box over everything you've saved, right on the page you're reading. Picking a result from another chat opens it there.
- One library holds every highlight from every site, labelled with where it came from, filterable by site and searchable by text, note, chat name or site.
- Clicking a highlight opens that page and scrolls straight to it, re-using the tab if it's already open.
- Every highlight has a copyable link that lands on the exact spot. It is an ordinary URL
  text fragment, so it works for people who don't have Kona, and on a phone.
- Filter by tag as well as by site, and search covers tags too.
- Export what you're looking at as Markdown — one section per chat, with your notes, tags and a link back — which drops straight into Obsidian or Notion.
- Export a backup file of everything and import it on another computer.
- Light, dark or match-your-system, chosen in the library and used everywhere, including the panel inside chats.

**When pages change**
- Highlights are found again by their text and its surroundings, so they survive re-renders, edited messages and changed message ids.
- A copy of the text is saved with each highlight, so you keep it even if the chat is deleted.
- If a site changes its layout, the panel says so instead of failing silently.

## Install

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open `chrome://extensions`, turn on **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked** and choose `.output/chrome-mv3`. Works in Chrome, Edge and Brave.

Open a chat on chatgpt.com, claude.ai or gemini.google.com and select some text. For any other site, click the Kona button in the toolbar and switch that site on; Chrome will ask you to allow it.

## On a phone (Android)

Chrome on Android has no extensions, and Google has not said it ever will. So the phone
version is a small installable web app instead of an extension, in `app/`.

Select text anywhere on the phone — a browser, Reddit, a PDF reader — tap **Share**, pick
**Kona**, and the passage is kept with its page and title. Add a note and tags, search
everything later, and **Open original** takes you back to the exact sentence using a URL
text fragment, which every modern browser understands without anything installed.

```bash
npm run dev:app     # http://localhost:5179
npm run build:app   # a static site in .output/app
```

Serve `.output/app` over HTTPS — GitHub Pages is enough — open it on your phone and use
*Add to Home screen*. Sharing only appears once it is installed.

It keeps its own highlights, separate from the desktop ones; nothing syncs between them.
The backup file is the same format in both, so you can carry highlights across by hand.
iPhone is not supported: Safari does not let a web app register as a share target.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Alt+Shift+H` | Highlight the selected text in yellow |
| `Alt+Shift+N` | Highlight it and open a note |
| `Alt+Shift+↓` / `↑` | Go to the next or previous highlight, with a "3 of 7" marker |
| `Alt+Shift+F` | Search everything you've highlighted, without leaving the page |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Save the note you're writing |
| `Esc` | Close the note without saving |
| `↑` / `↓` on the ⋮⋮ grip | Move a highlight up or down the list |

The first two are also listed along the bottom of the panel, and a welcome page walks through all of it the first time you install.

## Privacy

Everything is stored in your browser, and the extension makes no network requests of any kind. It asks for access to the three chat sites, plus whichever sites you switch on yourself — nothing else. Your backup file is the only copy that leaves the browser, and only when you export one.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev       # Chrome with the extension loaded, rebuilding on save
npm test          # unit tests for anchoring, ordering, search and backups
npm run compile   # type check
npm run build     # production build in .output/chrome-mv3
```

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Site-specific markup — the only part that should break when a site changes | `src/adapters/` |
| Flattening a message's text and mapping offsets to DOM ranges | `src/core/textIndex.ts` |
| Storing a highlight as quote + surrounding context, and finding it again | `src/core/quote.ts` |
| Finding the right message by id, fingerprint or nearby position | `src/core/locate.ts` |
| Painting highlights with the CSS Custom Highlight API, without touching the page | `src/core/painter.ts` |
| Panel order, search, backups, deep links | `src/core/order.ts`, `search.ts`, `backup.ts`, `link.ts` |
| The Android web app — shares `src/core` with the extension | `app/` |
| Page logic: selection, navigation, jumping, storage | `src/content/controller.ts` |
| Panel, toolbar and note card (Preact, in a shadow root) | `src/ui/` |
| Library page, welcome page, toolbar popup, background script | `src/entrypoints/` |

## Fixing a site that broke

When a site changes its layout, the panel shows a warning. The fix is usually a selector change in that site's adapter, for example `src/adapters/chatgpt.ts`. Each adapter answers the same few questions — where the messages are, which are yours, where a message's text lives, and whether a reply is still being written — so nothing outside that file should need touching.
